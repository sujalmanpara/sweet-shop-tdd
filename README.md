## 🔄 TDD Journey

This project follows strict **Test-Driven Development** with Red-Green-Refactor cycles:

### 🔴 Red Phase - Failing Tests

*Writing failing tests first to define expected behavior. Tests fail as expected since the functionality doesn't exist yet.*

### 🟢 Green Phase - Passing Tests
![Green Phase](./screenshots code to make tests pass. Focus on making tests green with the simplest possible solution.*

### 🔵 Refactor Phase - Code Improvement

*Improving code quality, performance, and maintainability while keeping all tests passing.*
